TopDown
-------

I've been fascinated with Pratt's [Top-down operator precedence][1] for a while, ever since reading [Douglas Crockford's description][2] in Beautiful code.  I've also wanted to start playing with Python, ever since half the London office took off to play with it for pay.  This project looks like a good way to do both.

Nothing breakthrough here, and nothing new at all (in fact, it's [been done and well-documented already][3]), but I think it'll be fun.
